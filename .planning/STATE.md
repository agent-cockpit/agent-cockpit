# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-04)

**Core value:** One unified approval, memory, and replay layer across Claude Code and Codex — so developers can run agents productively, not just watch them.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Daemon Core

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Daemon-first order is dictated by the feature dependency tree — every UI feature requires the local daemon
- Roadmap: Approval timeout logic ships in Phase 2 with the first approval implementation, not as a follow-up
- Roadmap: Office mode is Phase 9 (last) — additive display layer on proven Zustand store, no data model dependencies
- Roadmap: Codex adapter is Phase 4 (after browser UI shell) — isolated adapter boundary avoids contaminating core architecture validation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 planning: Claude Code hook configuration schema (`~/.claude/settings.json`) and PermissionRequest hook response envelope need verification against current Claude Code version before planning
- Phase 4 planning: Codex app-server initialization handshake sequence may have changed in recent CLI versions — capture fixture files at planning time
- Phase 7 planning: CLAUDE.md auto-memory format and agent-suggested memory hook event names need confirmation before planning
